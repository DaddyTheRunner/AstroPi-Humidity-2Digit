# AstroPi-Humidity-2Digit

This simple Python code displays the humidity reading reported by the Astro-Pi's sensor. If the humidity is going up, the digits are displayed in <span style="color:green">green</span>, if it is going down they are <span style="color:red">red</span>, and (you guessed it) <span style="color:orange">orange</span> if the values is unchanged from the previous reading.
